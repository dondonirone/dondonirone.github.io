          "First Mode: Deathmatch  The first mode that I’m going to talk about is Deathmatch. In Deathmatch, Its pretty easy and fun. You start out as an adult fish, and for the sake of this guide, lets use the Great Map and the bibos for example. So, you are a level one Bibos and are trying to search for food. Just eat the Barnicles (the pink puffy little balls that stick to the walls and the floor, and occasionally floating) and the starfish. After your level 10, you can definitely hunt something small and buy a new fish"

          "Second Mode: Survival If this news is old, please consult me in the comments section. Survival is easy. Its not as fun as Deathmatch, because everybody knows now that Deathmatch has the unfair advantage that allows you to grow as big as you please, survival is what I like to imagine as the beginner’s mode. You start as a reef fish, but whats this? “I’M AN EGG?” You exclaim, TIME SLOWS AND THE FIERY DEVICE GLOWS WITH EVILNESS… No, just kidding. But the answer to the first part was, of course you’re and egg, its survival! The computer even tells you this–press space until you hatch"

          "Third Mode: Crab Madness Crab Madness is, in my opinion, the hardest mode you can play. Remember that fun time playing as a Bibos and you and your gang were having a great time hunting crabs? Well, think about the crabs’ perspective. Wouldn’t it be impossible to live as a crab when every fish there is your enemy? Sharks, Bibos, and all those other predators will hunt you at there time and place of their choosing. I haven’t played Crab Madness because its really buggy, but it seems cool. I would recommend if you were totally into challenges that included difficulty surviving as a poor helpless crab. Mods! “Wait, what? I thought it was the end!” You might say"

You could be a Penguin, a Jellyfish, A seal, a Squid, and even the Octopus. (Again i’m using The Great Map for example) The’re plenty more, but I just mentioned a few. I’m not going to spoil the rest, but if you want to explore the rest of it, go ahead! Multiplayer! Multiplayer is a mode that you can play as right when you launch the game"

          "Get Quick Money  I kept using Pinky and the starter fish, until I got enough coins for Bibos. Remember to NOT HAVE GANG ON until you're a decent level after growing. Turn gang on and get eggs. You should lay them in one of the holes with a rock over it at your spawn. Go to the crabs, and tell your babies to stay at a far away area so the crabs don't get them. Kill the crabs, tell the children to come over so they can eat, and repeat. Once you've got enough coins for the cuttlefish, become the cuttlefish when you want to"

          "The cuttlefish has two spawns: The one I refer to as the unlucky spawn, and the lucky spawn.  I can only remember the unlucky spawn, where crabs usually come and kill you when you're a baby which will basically make all that grinding go down the drain. The unlucky spawn is near the shark temple area, so if there's crabs there, just zoom away as fast as you can when you've finished spamming space.  Just.. eat a ton of stuff, go over to the area where pinkies and the starting fish spawn near the unlucky spawn, and start eating them"

          "Oh, and that shoal of tiny little sardines you keep seeing? You don’t need to hunt those, just swallow them and you get a decent amount of heath points. Any questions? Do I Hunt the Mahi Mahi’s? What Level? DO NOT hunt the Mahi Mahis at level 10 or below. They will kill you if your under lvl 10. Deathmatch is the fun mode because you can grow as big as the entire map, and more! The screen will shake and it will get super laggy if your level 500 or more. And keep in mind that other fish will try to hunt you more in this mode. I was a level 11 Bibos really far in the shallows when a mahi mahi attacked me. Also, Deathmatch will not save your coins. Don’t get a crazy amount of coins and expect the game to save your progress. Your progress won’t be lost achievement-wise"
